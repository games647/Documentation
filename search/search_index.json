What is the NMS Maven Repository? \u00b6 Note Replace {version} with whatever version you want to use. The version has the same syntax as the version of the Spigot-API (e.g. 1.15.2-R0.1-SNAPSHOT ) Add the following parts to your pom.xml when using Maven: <repositories> <repository> <id> nms-repo </id> <url> https://repo.codemc.io/repository/nms/ </url> </repository> </repositories> <dependencies> <dependency> <groupId> org.spigotmc </groupId> <artifactId> spigot </artifactId> <version> {version} </version> <scope> provided </scope> </dependency> </dependencies> Add this to your build.gradle file when using Gradle. repositories { maven { url = \"https://repo.codemc.io/repository/nms/\" } } dependencies { compileOnly ( group: 'org.spigotmc' , name: 'spigot' , version: '{version}' ) } How can my projec(s) be added to CodeMC? \u00b6 To get your project(s) added, join the CodeMC Discord and contact an Administrator. When doing so, make sure to follow those basic guides: Provide your GitHub username. GitHub is the main system to login on the site. You need to have at least one open source project (Private repositories don't count). Please stay patient when requesting to be added as we might have other things to do. My project isn't about Minecraft. Can I still be added? \u00b6 Yes, you can. CodeMC accept nearly every open source project, as long as it is Java-based (And follows the points in the above FAQ entry). I can't access any job configuration or folders in my Organisation. What is happening? \u00b6 You need to make sure to have granted access to your organisation when you logged in the first time. To check this, head over to your Connection Settings on GitHub and make sure to have granted the CodeMC application access to your account and organisations. How can I deploy my maven artifacts to the CodeMC repository? \u00b6 When you use Maven can you add the following settings to your pom.xml <distributionManagement> <repository> <id> codemc-releases </id> <url> https://repo.codemc.io/repository/maven-releases/ </url> </repository> <snapshotRepository> <id> codemc-snapshots </id> <url> https://repo.codemc.io/repository/maven-snapshots/ </url> </snapshotRepository> </distributionManagement> Alternatively can you also execute an upload to the repository through the command line.

If you try to deploy from outside of it will you receive an \"Unauthorized\" exception. Prerequisites \u00b6 Before you can publish your project to the nexus will you need to make a few first steps to have everything setup and running. Login \u00b6 To get started, first go to your project's Jenkins Page on CodeMC ( https://ci.codemc.io/job/:user/job/:project ) and login to your account if you didn't already. Configure Project \u00b6 On the project's page, click :fa-solid-cog: Configure to go to the project settings. From there, scroll down to the Build Enviroment section and click on Use secret text(s) or file(s) . A new section called Bindings should now open.

Enter the names for the User and Password Variable that you want to use. Common examples to use are ORG_GRADLE_PROJECT_mavenUsername and ORG_GRADLE_PROJECT_mavenPassword Note Do NOT enter your actual username and password in those fields. They are only used to define the Enviroment Variables used on Jenkins. Under Credentials leave Specific credentials selected and use jenkins-deploy/****** (jenkins-deploy) from the dropdown menu. Continue to the Build section. No Build step set?
